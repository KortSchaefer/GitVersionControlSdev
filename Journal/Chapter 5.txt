Chapter 5: Commits.

Make small, focused commits (future you will thank present you)

one idea per commit, keep the blast radius tiny

Write better messages (not poetry, just useful)

short subject (“Fix off-by-1 in loop”), then a blank line, then why/how if needed

Fix a fresh mistake w/ amend

git commit --amend (typo in msg? forgot a file? add it + amend)

note: don’t amend stuff you already pushed/shared unless team is cool w/ it

Peek inside commits + blame (not mean blame, just info)

git show <hash>, git blame file.py to see who/when lines changed

Shaping history (lite intro)

squash/fixup during PRs to keep main clean, but don’t rewrite shared history like a maniac

If you want, toss me a chapter/exercise and I’ll rewrite it in this same messy-human style with the exact commands you’ll run.
